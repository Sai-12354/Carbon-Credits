## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Location Management Integration
**Challenge**: Integrating Google Maps API with location management while ensuring proper marker placement and address validation.

**Solution**: Implemented a dual map system - one for viewing all locations and another in the modal for precise location selection. Added geocoding support for address validation and reverse geocoding.

### Challenge 2: Credit Calculation Logic
**Challenge**: Creating a fair and incentivizing system for calculating carbon credits based on transportation mode and distance.

**Solution**: Developed a configurable multiplier system where different transport modes earn different credit rates per kilometer, encouraging the most sustainable options.

### Challenge 3: Transaction Security
**Challenge**: Ensuring marketplace transactions are secure, verifiable, and cannot be manipulated.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-step verification process with bank admin approval for high-value transactions and detailed transaction logging.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the employee trip logging feature
2. Enhance dashboard visualizations with charts and graphs
3. Implement remaining employee features
4. Begin Super Admin dashboard development
5. Conduct comprehensive testing
6. Prepare for production deployment

## Conclusion
The Carbon Credits Platform has made significant progress, with all core administrator and employer features complete. The focus is now on implementing the employee features and preparing for final deployment. The platform is on track to meet its goals of incentivizing sustainable commuting and creating a functional carbon credit marketplace.
